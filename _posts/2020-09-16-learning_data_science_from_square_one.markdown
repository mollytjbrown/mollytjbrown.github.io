     I decided to learn data science on a whim. I have never felt specifically connected to any of the various majors I chose in college, inluding my most recent one (accounting) which I abandonned for Flatiron's self-paced data science program. Before accounting, I was interetsed in special education, and before that; architecture. 
		 
		 My own personal square one, was a dabble in coding my myspace page, and as a kid, coding my storefront on an online game called Neopets. All of my (very limited) coding experience, was design, and mostly HTML. Here and there, I would google specific coding packages to find pre-written backgrounds or fonts. Despite my dad begging me to learn code ever since I was around 12, data science never crossed my mind until a girl friend of mine sent me a link to a video, where a woman my age was describing the coding successes she found through Flatiron.
		 
		 I did a Google search, and about 20 minutes of superficial research, and I decided to apply. I immediately called my dad- he was thrilled, of course, and then moments passed and I felt anxiety (what if I'm not smart enough?) and guilt for abandonning yet another life plan. 
		 
		 Not long after I submitted an application, I recieved an email about scheduling an interview and enrolling in a prep course. I scheduled my interview for a Thursday afternoon, and I took the afternoon off of work to sit at home and prepare. 
		 
		 I asked myself: what are my strong suits? Well, I'm thoughtful, good at writing, and a quick learner. I jittered around my living room until my interview began, and when it came eventually, I was ready. The interviewer and I chatted on Zoom for what seemed like about an hour, and the conversation flowed effortlessly. In no time, I recieved my email of acceptance, and then officially enrolled. 
		 
		 I was nervous then, and I'm nervous now. Constantly, I wonder if I can keep up, or if I'm learning the way I should be. The tricky part about coding, I'm learning, is that there isn't always a perfect answer. I like a perfect answer, and so leaving room for interpretation is difficult for me, and leaves me second-guessing myself often. In math, when you show your work and get the correct answer, you are correct. In writing, if you have a matching subject, verb, and independent clause, you've made a sentence. With code, you write, and you tweak, and when you run the code, you recieve either an answer or an error, and sometimes, the answer you recieve isn't exactly the answer you were looking for. 
		 
		 I am learning every day how to be better at Googling. Copy and pasting error messages doesn't always cut it, and now that I'm learning more about the answer I want to recieve, I'm improving my tactics on how to ask the questions I need to get there. I do find myself frustrated when I get stuck every so often, because I back-track myself into confusion, and no one in my immediate circle can help me out. I feel lucky that Flatiron has so many built-in resources to help me, and I've found that one good thing about coders, is that they're often on the internet. 
		 
		 Now, I'm on my way to shut my office door and Zoom call with my advisor with the final version of my Module 1 project, which is an inspection of some move-related data. I am nervous, as usual, and I'm not confident in my work, as usual. Thusfar, my lack of faith in myself has gone unsupported by any evidence, and I'm hoping that this project review yeilds the same result. When the reivew is complete, if my spirits aren't crushed, I'll be back to edit this post!
